Our custom CNC fabricated sheet metal rear-end differential housings are cut and faced using our CNC mills, then fixture welded in our specific built jigs for perfect alignment and final dimensioning. We specialize in SFI 25.1E, 25.2, 25.4  an 25.5  chassis construction.

All of our metal forming, welding, and CNC equipment is top-notch American made. Our mill-spec 4130 chromoly tubing is cut using a dedicated dry  carbide  blade,  eliminating  any   possibility of  contamination  from  dissimilar  metals  during welding. Every tube is precision notched on tangent to precisely fit the adjacent tube, taking advantage of longer perimeter welds with greater strength on different diameter tubes. Deburring, scale removal, and cleaning are performed at all tube junctions prior to TIG welding.
